Instructions to use run the algorithm.

> 1) There are 2 folders, Top1 for Question Parts A and B, TopK for Question Parts C and D.
> 2) In each folder there is a _`main.py`_ which is the executable Python File and other folders that handle reading and writing of graphs, as well as organise the input and output files.
> 3) For both algorithms, place the file containing the Graph and Hospitals list in the folder _`./textfiles`_.
> 4) Run the program in your **Terminal** window with the following format:
>> - `python3 main.py textfiles/`_`GraphFileName`_`.txt textfiles/`_`HospitalFileName`_`.txt`_`[K]`_
>> - Enter `[K]` when running TopK
> 5) The output will be in the _`./outputs`_ folder as _`results.txt`_
